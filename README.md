# ECG

ECG is a tool that augments embedded operating system fuzzing via LLM-based corpus generation that approaches fuzzing embedded operating system by automatically generating input specifications based on readily available source code and documentation, instrumenting and intercepting execution behavior for directional guidance information, and generating inputs with payloads according to the pre-generated input specifications and directional hints provided from previous runs.
